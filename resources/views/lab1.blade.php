        <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
        <p>
        The laboratory 1 consist of the installation and configuration of LARAVEL. Wherein the objectives are to install and configure Laravel,
        setting up the database connection, creating a Laravel Project, and creating basic views and routes.  
        </p>
        <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
        <p>
        I learned how to install Herd via Laravel Herd and how to configure it. I also learned how to create my first project by using commandprompt(CMD)
        and configuring the environment settings. And I also created the three views (Home, About, and Contents) that will be the pages of my website and 
        I also learned that in naming the views it must have the .blade.php because The .blade.php extension indicates that this file uses Blade,
        Laravelâ€™s templating engine. Blade allows you to use PHP code within your HTML templates in a clean and concise manner. I also learned to 
        define routes in the routes/web.php file, which is very important so that the website will work properly. Routes handles the user requests 
        that are intended to be viewed in a browser, routes manages the flow of the websites depending on what the user wanted.
